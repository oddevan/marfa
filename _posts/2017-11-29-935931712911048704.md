As others have reported, the fix for the [@Apple](https://twitter.com/Apple) bug is out.

It does NOT require a reboot.

If you have auto updates on, it may already be installed.

If itâ€™s not already installed, install it. Now.

(Side note, this looks like &lt;24h turnaround on this bug! Good job!)
