<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Quick question: What’s the album that hit you perfectly? For me it’s, “August and everything after” by Counting Crows. I remember being on a date in high school that was doomed and trying to get her to listen to the lyrics in the car. What’s your album?

Free At Last by DC Talk. It was such a fun album and really got my musical sensibilities.
