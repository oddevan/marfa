I've updated my local channel guide for streaming services in Greenville, SC: [eph.me/locals](https://eph.me/locals)

[@YouTubeTV](https://twitter.com/YouTubeTV) now has all 4 major networks despite missing important cable networks.
[@PlayStation](https://twitter.com/PlayStation) Vue, best service otherwise, still has no locals.

Yes, this is a callout post.
