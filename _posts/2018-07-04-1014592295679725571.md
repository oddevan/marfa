[@BungieHelp](https://twitter.com/BungieHelp) The beginning of the Insight Terminus strike is very difficult to find when the radar is off. Couldn’t find a waypoint without it, so me and the other newbie to the strike got lost on Nessus. Anything y’all can do to make the strike entrance more obvious w/o radar?
